This is because the present STM education has not achieved its aim of making graduates self-reliant. Entrepreneurship education if introduced in the STM education will produce graduate who can effectively manage their personal businesses. Entrepreneurship education was explained and the advantages outlined. The paper gave an insight into what the chemistry education will look like when entrepreneurship education is included using secondary school chemistry. This situation applies to biology education and in the application of technology to teaching and learning.",

The findings of the study report that distance education is playing a vital role in the expansion of female education at higher level as such females who, due to some personal or social compulsions, are not able to attend regular institution/university in order to enhance their educational, distance education proves to be a blessing for such females. Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) is the pioneer in provision of distance education in Pakistan and at present it is playing a significant role in provision of better higher education facilities, especially females are enjoying from these educational facilities as the system of AIOU is flexible enough for females and it provides them equal opportunity to uplift their educational status in spite of the different hurdles in the way of getting higher education without disturbing their family or personal problems. More incentives for females on the part of AIOU for getting higher education may increase the number of female students in AIOU programs of higher education in Pakistan.

In the relevant literature, concepts of democratic authority and education have been approached from two different perspectives. One of these perspectives is the democratic school/education approach based on the alternative education paradigm, which is not practiced in Turkey. The second perspective is the democracy approach in school/education. This study seeks an answer to how the process in which students get involved in the administration of the higher education institutions works. In order to reveal students tendency between aforementioned paradigms their views and needs about their participation in the decision making process were analyzed. Within this framework, two focus groups including students at Marmara University in the 2011-2012 academic year who are taking part in the student council and those who are not taking part in the council have been focused on. The results of the study have been found by means of the content analysis of the data. The results that can be categorized under three content categories have been compared with the literature regarding the alternative education and democratic school. According to the results, significant differences were found between students taking part in the council and those who were not members of the council in terms of handling some facts and concepts using the terminology in the literature pertaining to democratic education/ school. According to the results, some suggestions have been discussed. The results of the study are also likely to lead to a set of recommendations on the basis of barriers set in front of students' participation to shape the democratic authority at higher education institutions and their suggestions.",

While the idea of \"localizing\" education was sound, early program success was undermined by a lack of clarity behind terms like \"rural\" or \"community.\" This was exacerbated by a change in the scope of the project beyond its original objectives. Only by well defining the specific constituents of a target group and fulfilling their precise needs can myriad small-scale programs ultimately aggregate to meet the diverse demands and desires of society writ large.",

Each category is given a code for the purpose of reporting special education data to Alberta Education. A child or student must meet the criteria in order to be assigned a special education code. The need for special education may be determined at any time. The process of identifying such need focuses on the impact of the special education condition on the child's or student's functioning in an educational environment. This is accomplished through: (1) a comprehensive, individualized assessment; (2) a specialized assessment completed every two to five years; (3) an individualized program plan (IPP) with the involvement of the parent(s) and school personnel; and (4) an annual review of functioning and programming.

This condition has proven difficult to treat effectively, especially in terms of sustainable weight loss. The project described in this report embarked on multidimensional, community-based efforts to prompt a national discussion of the obesity issue and the need for multidimensional approaches in both research and education. A University of Wyoming-based research team developed the Wellness IN (WIN) the Rockies project to emphasize a health-centered approach that focused on three key parameters: (1) physical activity; (2) body image; and (3) food choice behaviors. While elementary-school children were a targeted intervention group, programs and policies throughout the community were assessed relative to their impacts on these parameters. Participating communities were in rural areas of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. The preliminary study found that adults with a higher Body Mass Index were more likely to drink sweetened beverages, order super-sized portions, eat while doing other activities and participate in less physical activity. Body dissatisfaction was associated with a decreased likelihood to participate in physical activity. The project engaged local citizens and gave them access to a number of different community-based intervention techniques. Communities initiated physical activities, such as walking programs. In preparation for the activities, project staff distributed pedometers to help motivate and reinforce behavioral change. Strategically placed billboards replaced counter-productive advertising with messages about valuing health. Simultaneously, health awareness programs in the schools encouraged students to take this important health message home to influence family behavior. WIN the Rockies team members served as catalysts to community change, but local leaders emerged to assure long-term viability of the programs for the community. A Web site developed during the WIN the Rockies project continues to impact research and education about healthy lifestyles and weight, offering resources at no cost to educators and health care providers. WIN the Rockies is being integrated into existing programs and services to extend the influence of the project into the future",

From a  workforce and tax revenue standpoint, state rates of return on baccalaureate education are  far higher than those associated with any other educational step. Additional benefits  attributable to higher education--ranging from enhancements in citizen participation to  improved health and avoidance of public support--are equally easy to document. It is thus in every state's interest to increase the numbers of its citizens who attain a baccalaureate degree. And it is equally in every state's interest to ensure that those who do earn a degree have experienced the kind of high quality learning environments that yield levels of knowledge and skills that are nationally and internationally competitive. Every college and university can improve its graduation rates and enhance the quality of its undergraduate programs by creating the conditions that matter to student success. Decades of research studies show that one key factor is student engagement--the time and effort that students devote to their studies and related activities. Institutions can organize their classes and other learning opportunities so that students put more effort in and benefit more from such activities. SHEEOs and System Heads can do their part by ensuring that matters of undergraduate quality and student success remain central to the state's approaches to planning, resource allocation, and accountability. And while their direct responsibility remains largely confined to public institutions, they can increasingly establish policies that affect independent institutions as well. (Lists 3 sources.)",

The development of the system was based upon a three-year comparative case study of four principals representing rural and urban schools and included pre-kindergarten through 12th grade levels in a Midwestern state. The research generated information to create a computer program to assist undergraduates with the construction of their professional teaching portfolios.  As students used the computer program, portfolios were being constructed in many electronic formats. The identification of one accessible electronic system became necessary for student and program evaluation and for accreditation purposes. As a result, a development and a professional portfolio were created within a digital system. The system includes rubrics which connect the standards and the aggregation of data. This paper identifies the research, problem solving process, initiation, and ongoing refinement of a digital portfolio system for use with teacher job search, student evaluation, teacher education program improvement, and aggregation of data for accreditation purposes.",

Ten years after the first commercial systems were made available to colleges and universities, many institutions of higher education are still struggling to determine the best way to support their educational missions with CMSs and other web technologies. Utilizing a mixed methods case study approach, the study explored the perceptions of the students and faculty, in the business programs, at a large, urban, multiculturally diverse college in Ontario which has a history of CMS use. The reasons for using a CMS in the college's business programs, the characteristics of the use of the CMS that enhanced learning and those that created barriers to learning and their perceptions about what constitutes the effective use of the CMS were explored. The main focus of this study was the examination of the students' perspective, as the aim of the study was to understand the effect of the CMS on their learning. Teaching and learning are inextricably connected; therefore obtaining the faculty's perspective was an important, but secondary, part of the study. This research was carried out at a large, urban and multiculturally diverse college in southern Ontario. This college was selected because it has been using some form of a CMS since 1997 and the current CMS has been implemented at the college since 2000. Some of the findings include: (1) The students and professors who participated in this study both affirmed that the main purpose for using the CMS was for the delivery of and access to information; (2) Increased access to information was the characteristic of the use of the CMS that the professors felt was most beneficial to learning. The comments from the professors indicated that the more information available to the students the \"more\" that they would learn; (3) The professors agreed with the students that if the use of the CMS replaced \"teaching\", which was equated with the students being able to get all the information without attending class, it would be a barrier to learning. They were quite concerned about the students not attending class if material was posted online; and (4) The mixed reaction to the effective use of the discussion board which the students discussed was shared by the professors.

However, in most provinces and territories these policies are serving more as barriers than supports in addressing the needs of students with acquired brain injuries (ABI). Within Canada, only two provinces acknowledge ABI as an exceptionality in any significant way. For the most part, ABI is under-recognized and often poorly responded to in Canada's educational systems. The issues associated with the problematic delivery of services to students with ABI include: the lack of federal guidelines as to the definition of \"exceptionality\", the lack of awareness of ABI as an exceptionality requiring accommodation, the connection between the categorization of exceptionalities and funding, and the lack of training and support for educators. The ramifications of these issues and the changes in educational policy needed to adequately address these issues are discussed with reference to children's right to education. (Contains 2 tables.)",

There are three types of education at American community colleges: university parallel programs, career education, and continuing education. The university parallel programs are sometimes referred to as the two-plus-two concept, meaning a student will complete two years of study at the community college before transferring to a university. The strongest argument for offering the two-plus-two program at the local community college is accessibility, economics, and teaching and learning support. Career education is, by design, not developed nor structured to be transferable. Therefore,  unlike the college transfer track, career programs will vary in length from several months to a maximum of two years in most U.S. community colleges. Finally, continuing education at community colleges offer mostly noncredit courses. This unit of instruction was not designed for transfer and plays an important role in the economic development of the local community by assisting in the upgrading of employment skills. This document also discusses articulation agreements between two- and four-year institutions in America and other countries and provides recommendations for improving the transfer process. (JA)",

The lawsuit charges that the state has underfunded the City's public schools, thus denying City students a sound basic education. The lawsuit is also the first case to thoroughly analyze the history of standards-based school reform and its important relationship to constitutional equity and adequacy litigation on behalf of children everywhere. The flawed structure and operation of the state's finance system are responsible for its inability to deliver adequate resources to City students. This report explains why the system does not work, demonstrating that the present  funding system does not deliver resources adequate to meet students' needs because it is not set up to do this (there is no mechanism for assessing need). The report discusses how the state funds education; state finance system shortchanges in the City's public schools; education costs not being a factor in the state finance system; the state being legally required to safeguard City schools' access to adequate resources; and recent aid increases not being able to replace systemic reform. Until New York implements a cost-based education finance system, no amount of increased spending can remedy its fundamental failure to ensure that every year enough money is provided to offer a sound basic education to all students.
